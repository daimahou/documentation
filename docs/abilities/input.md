# Ability Input Module

The ability input module allows the user to define key binding to cast abilities that have been slotted in the [caster feature](../features/caster/).

- **Input:** List of input mappings. Adding a new entry will bind a slotted ability from the [caster feature](../features/caster/) to the specified input action.
- **Ground layer:** Layer used for raycasting on the ground.
- **Cast at maximum range** When casting an ability to an out of range location, the controller will instead pick a new nearby location at max range.
