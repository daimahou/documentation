To use abilities, first you need to install the latest version of **Game Creator**. You can find the detailed procedure by clicking on the [documentation link](https://docs.gamecreator.io/gamecreator/getting-started/installation/).


Get the **Abilities** package from the Unity Asset Store following the link below:

Once you have purchased it, click on the *Import* button on the website and the Unity Editor's Package Manager window should appear with the **Ability** package selected. Click on Download and Import afterwards.

Before going further, please make sure that you have downloaded and installed **UniRX**, a free library extension for Unity. You can find it in the asset store at the following link.

[Get UniRX :fontawesome-brands-unity: ](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/unirx-reactive-extensions-for-unity-17276){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

Once this process completed, you will have a new "Game Creator" menu at the top-toolbar. Open it the menu and click on *Install...* The following window will open.
