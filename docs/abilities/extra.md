## Indicators

Indicators are simply a scriptable object wrapper meant for visual indicators. The only field is for the game object prefab, optionally you can set it up for pooling (which is recommended with a value of 1).

Its purpose is to make it easier to pick when creating abilities.


### Creating an indicator

Indicators are scriptable objects and to create one, you'll need to right click on the Project Panel and navigate to Create → Game Creator → Abilities → Indicator.
