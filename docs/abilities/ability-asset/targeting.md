# Target System

## Cast on Self

## Cast on Closest Target

This targeting system will look for each potential target in the specify radius around the user location and select the closest one. This method acquires the target at input time ([#2](../#execution-sequence)), meaning that once the animation starts, the target will always get hit. This can be avoided by using requirements.
