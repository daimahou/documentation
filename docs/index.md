# Welcome to Daimahou

Daimahou is a *collection of modules* specifically designed to blend with the Game Creator 2 eco-system. The **philosophy of Daimahou** is to create tools to **rapidly prototype** particular game features in a very short amount of time.

The main *goal* of Daimahou is to ***remove all the technical steps*** to add features to your game so that you can **focus on the design aspect** which will <u>make your game shine</u>. By removing all the setup friction, you are free to experiment with feature combination, customize their behaviour and quickly converge to the fun part of your gameplay idea.

With this in mind, welcome to the core [documentation](features/index/md).
