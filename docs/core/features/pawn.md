# Pawn Component

Pawn is a component used internally by Daimahou Core to add various features to game objects. It is generally added automatically when needed. As a rule of thumb, you can add a pawn component to your characters and game objects that interact with Daimahou systems by clicking *Add component* in the inspector and navigating to *Game Creator -> Daimahou -> Pawn*
