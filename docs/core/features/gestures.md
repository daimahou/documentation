# Reactive Gesture

Reactive gestures allows to synchronize logic events and store data directly with the animation. This is particularly useful to trigger sound effects and visual effects at the exact timing.

The system is also used to trigger the activation of an ability so that, for example, the damage is only delivered at the exact time the sword connects with the target. Moreover, the system also allows the user to execute custom logic and synchronize it's execution with the animation.
