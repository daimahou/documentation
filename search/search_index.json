Creating such systems is a difficult task, this is why we developed Abilities, a series of tools that will allow you, the designer, to implement YOUR ideas intuitively in a short amount of time . General information Who is it for ? Abilities has been created for designers . The philosophy behind abilities is to create a wide set of tools that designers can use to craft their own abilities without the need for additional code. Built upon Game Creator 2 , you get access to an incredible wealth of tools to supercharge your creativity. Abilities is packed with features of its own, targeting system, animation synchronization, projectiles and more. Designed to play well with other modules, you can stop worrying about technicalities and focus on making games . What is it ? A suite of tools that allows the designer to create abilities with synchronized animation and effects. Reactive Gesture : allows you to synchronize animation effortlessly Abilities : allows you to create abilities with customizable components. Projectiles & Impacts : allows you to configure projectiles with custom trajectory, spawn pattern and impact effects. Abilities are defined by 5 different sub-systems designed to be flexible and easy to use. Targeting system : Let you choose how the targets are selected. Activation system : Let you choose how the ability is executed - e.g. is it a direct spell or a chanelled spell. Requirement system : Let you define conditions that needs to be met for the ability to can be casted - e.g. cooldown, mana cost, or even arbitrary conditions. Filter system : Let you define conditions that needs to be met for a target to be valid. Useful for removing friendly fire, or to create conditional effects - e.g. targets need to be on fire to be affected. Effect system : Let you specify what the ability will do once valid targets have been selected - e.g. applying damage, spawning projectiles, etc. How does it work ? Very simple, yet extremely powerful approach. There is only 4 steps to create all the abilities you dreamt of. Configure your animations using the reactive gesture system to synchronize your effects and instructions precisely how YOU want. Configure your ability strategies so they apply to the targets of YOUR choice. Specify the effects of your ability to match YOUR design. Spice up your ability by adding projectiles and impact which you can customize to create the abilities YOU envision. Errata If you find a mistake or omission in the documentation, please send us an email at daimahou.studio@gmail.com with a link to the relevant entry and an explanation what you think is wrong.

Creating an ability Ability Inspector An Ability asset will appear, with a list of sections that can be expanded or collapsed so it is easy for the user to modify and organize their abilities. Ability inspector - folded The ID value is a unique text that represents an ability. When creating a new asset, it will be completely unique. However, duplicating an existing ability will also duplicate the ID and a red message will appear above stating that there are two items with the same ID. To solve that, expand the field and click on the Regenerate button to create a new unique ID. You can also type in a name if you follow a naming convention that ensures that all item IDs are unique. The Icon field is used to represent the ability in UI, if not set, a white square will be used instead. The Range field represents the distance within which the ability can reach. Main features An Ability is defined by a scriptable object inside your project folder. It is organized into multiple collapse-able sections, each of which controls a very specific feature of this system. Targeting : An input system that allows to change how the targets are acquired by the system. Automatically find the closest target, centers around the caster or at the mouse click are some of the different options. Activation : Controls how the ability activates its effect on the target and how input is processed. Some options are a single activation driven by an animation, or a channeling effect that stays active as long as it is on. Requirements : Define conditions which needs to be met in order to for an ability to be cast-able. Some requirements can also prevent an ability from activate and/or apply a cost to it, e.g. cooldown or mana cost. Filters : Define conditions that are used to filter the valid targets for your ability, e.g. filtering the caster to prevent friendly fire. Effects : Controls what the ability actually do, once it has activated and found valid targets, e.g. damaging a target, spawning projectiles or explosion impacts and more. Ability inspector - unfolded Execution sequence When the ability is triggered, the Requirement system determines if the ability can be executed. The Targeting system triggers the input and, determine the location the ability will activate from. The Requirement system determines if the ability can be activated and activation costs are paid. The Activation system decides how the ability will play out. Typically an animation is played using the Reactive Gesture system. Then, the animation sends a signal back to complete the activation. The Targeting system works together with the Filter system to determines the valid target(s). Finally, the Effect system applies the effects on the valid targets. Context Menu You can access a context menu by right clicking on most elements. Elements can be replaced or disabled and documentation can be accessed through it. Systems Targeting System The targeting system is responsible for handling player input and acquiring targets . A target can be any game object or location. Depending on the system used, targeting happens in two phases. Once before activation to find the target location, and once after the activation to confirm the targets (c.f. #2 & #5 in the above graph ). Some settings have automatic input, e.g. Cast on Self will automatically use the caster as a target , while others will require the player input, e.g. Cast on Location requires the player to click on the ground . Targeting systems AI Input A target can be submitted directly to the ability using an instruction to allow AI to use abilities as well. Refer to the Instructions section for more information. Activation System The activation system is the center piece and dictates how the ability works. The most basic activation type is the Single activation , the abilities starts with an animation, applies its effects once, and then complete its execution with the end of the animation. Other activation types are Channeled and Charged activation. At the moment only the Single activation type is implemented, but more will be added in future updates. Requirement System The requirement system is responsible for controlling when the ability is use-able as well as managing its success conditions. Additionally it is also responsible for effects that are considered costs, e.g. cooldowns and mana costs . The requirements defined by this system are of 2 types : Requirement for use (#1) : Condition that needs to be met in order to cast the ability. In case of failure the ability will simply not start. Requirement for Activation (#4) : Condition that needs to be met in order for the effects to resolve. In case of failure, the animation will stop and the ability will fail. Additionally, a requirement can sometime have a side-effect (which is applied during the activation (#4) ), e.g. entering cooldown, or paying mana cost. Filter System The filter system is responsible for filtering targets according to filtering conditions. The most basic one is to filter out the caster to make sure the ability cannot backfire. Effect System The effect system defines what the ability will eventually do to its targets. This system is further enhanced by the projectiles & impacts system.","title":"Ability"},{"location":"abilities/ability-asset/#ability","text":"The most fundamental part of Abilities is the Ability asset.

A projectile defines the behavior of a single missile that can be reused in different abilities and be spawned in various ways using the projectile ability effect . Creating a projectile Projectiles are scriptable objects and to create one, you'll need to right click on the Project Panel and navigate to Create \u2192 Game Creator \u2192 Abilities \u2192 Projectile. Prefab : the prefab representing the projectile. The projectile is a physics object and is moved through physics, therefore it requires a trigger collider and a rigidbody to work properly. The system will automatically set it up for you, but you can custimize the projectile further by adding them youself. Acceleration : an animation curve that can be used to control the acceleration of the projectile over the distance between its spawn point and its target. Speed : the speed at which the projectile travel Projectile range : range of the projectile, used to determine the maximum travel distance. Pierce Target : determine if the projectile will be destroy on contact or if it can hit more targets after the first one. Always Destroy : if enabled, the projectile will always be destroyed, and its effect resolved after reaching its defined range (see above) Constant Range : the projectile will normally adjust its range to the distance between its spawn point and its target. If enable, the range will always be the one set above (useful for enabling various effects). Filters : same as abilities, see documentation . Effects : same as abilities, see documentation . Chain effects Although it is possible to add an effect on the projectile to spawn itself, it is not recommanded as it can get out of hand and spawn exponantially increasing number of projectiles. A better way is to spawn a different projectile or an impact instead, this way you always control what a projectile can spawn. Always keep organize and avoid circle dependencies that might crash Unity. Deviation Settings The settings under this foldout let you customize the trajectory of your projectile using animation curves. The animation curve can be set from 0 to 1 and is mapped to the range of the projectile. Constraints Always keep the time values between 0 and 1. Any values before 0 and after 1 will be ignored. Loop Deviation : if enabled, after traveling a distance equal to its range, repeats the deviation curve in a loop over its lifetime. Frequency : compressed the curve so that it repeats more often over the projectile range. Requires Loop Deviation . Randomize Deviation : pick a random start time on the curve each time the projectile is spawned. Requires Loop Deviation . Horizontal Deviation : curve controling the horizontal deviation. Vertical Deviation : curve controling the vertical deviation. Backward Deviation : curve controling the backward deviation. Be creative With the deviation settings you can easily create projectils that spirals towards their target, or lob unto them. Adaptive trajectory If you keep the constant range setting off, the deviation will always be mapped from the origin to the target. So if you set the projectile to move along a bell shaped curve, you can be sure that your projectile will always hit the target as expected. Homing settings The settings under this foldout let you modify your projectile to home to its target. The projectile will gradually adjust its direction until it hits its target. The homing precision allows you to control how aggresive it adjusts its direction. Impact An Impact represents another tool in your toolbelt to acquire targets and apply effects. An Impact will gather targets all around it, up to a certain distance and apply the impact effect on them. Creating an Impact Impacts are scriptable objects and to create one, you'll need to right click on the Project Panel and navigate to Create \u2192 Game Creator \u2192 Abilities \u2192 Impact. Prefab : prefab that is spawned at the impact position. Usually meant to be VFX only. We highly recommend using the pooling system on that one. Radius : distance within which targets are acquired. Delay : delay after which targets are acquired and effects applied. Filters : same as abilities, see documentation . Effects : same as abilities, see documentation . Impact delay Sometimes, VFX have a windup/buildup to their visuals, you can use the delay to apply the impact effect at the exact time you impact VFX detonates for maximum impact (pun intended).","title":"Projectile & Impacts"},{"location":"abilities/projectiles/#projectile-impacts","text":"","title":"Projectile &amp; Impacts"},{"location":"abilities/projectiles/#projectiles","text":"A projectile is a moving game object that works as a \"targeting system\" that is used to deliver ability effects to the poor soul who ends up colliding with it.
